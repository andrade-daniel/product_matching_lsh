Product Matching

An exploration on product matching techniques, namely the Local Sensitivity Hashing (LSH) and k-Nearest Neighbours.
Also, to show the gains and efficiency of LSH in these type of problems over solutions that are computionally expensive and time consuming.
It can be used to detect duplicates or even to serve as a recommendation system.

Considering the fact that we're dealing with product descriptions (i.e. text), it also explores some great features of the spaCy package (which I prefer over nltk) for text processing.
